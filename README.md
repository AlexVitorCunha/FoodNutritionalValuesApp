## Purpose

> This application was developed in my COMP1011 Advanced Object Oriented Programming-Java course at Georgian College.
> I was asked to create an application that takes information from a MySQL database and show it in two forms, as a chart 
> and as a table. The app also includes code to convert CSV to a SQL query. The database information was taken from 
> (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/nutrient-data.html).
